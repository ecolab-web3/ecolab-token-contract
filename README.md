## About The Project

This repository contains the official Solidity smart contracts for the **E-co.lab Token ($ECO)**. This is the core token contract for the E-co.lab ecosystem, designed to manage both the primary fungible token ($ECO) and future Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens.

The contract is built following the ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard and is designed to be upgradeable using the UUPS proxy pattern, ensuring long-term flexibility and security.

Built with **Hardhat** and **OpenZeppelin Contracts**.

### Key Features

*   **ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard:** A single contract to manage both the fungible `$ECO` token (ID 0) and an infinite number of unique RWA NFTs (IDs > 0).
*   **Upgradeable (UUPS Proxies):** The contract logic can be updated to add new features or fix bugs without requiring a token migration.
*   **Ownable Access Control:** Administrative functions like minting new tokens are restricted to a secure owner address, which will eventually be controlled by the E-co.lab DAO.
*   **Flexible Initialization:** Supports different configurations for name, symbol, and metadata URI, allowing for distinct deployments on testnets and mainnet.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v20 LTS recommended)
*   **npm** (comes with Node.js)
*   **Git**

### Installation

*   **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ecolab-web3/ecolab-token-contract.git
    ```
*   **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ecolab-token-contract
    ```
*   **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

This project uses Hardhat as its development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

*   **Compile the contracts:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
*   **Run tests:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Testing

This project is committed to the highest standards of quality and security, validated by a comprehensive test suite.

### Running Tests

*   **To run the full suite of unit tests, execute the following command:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```

*   **To generate a detailed test coverage report, run:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat coverage
    ```

### Coverage Summary

The test suite achieves 100% coverage for all executable lines of code and all functions written for the project's business logic.

| File                  | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
|-----------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| `ECOLAB_TOKEN.sol`    | 100     | 93.75    | 100     | 100     |
| `ECOLAB_TOKEN_V2.sol` | 100     | 100      | 100     | 100     |
| **All files**         | **100** | **93.75**| **100** | **100** |

**Note on Branch Coverage:** The 93.75% branch coverage is an excellent and expected result. The small remaining portion is related to internal, edge-case checks within the inherited OpenZeppelin UUPSUpgradeable contract. Our tests fully cover **100% of all custom logic and security-critical branches**, including the `onlyOwner` checks on all administrative and upgrade functions.

## Deployment

The V1.1.0 of the EcolabToken contract has been successfully deployed and verified on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.

### Avalanche Fuji Testnet

*   **Status:** **Completed** âœ…
*   **Current Active Proxy Address:**
    `0x2ab5510b2E954F95b1F9F50deA7d8CAF41C418AE`
*   **DEPRECATED (DO NOT USE):**
    `0x1beF1F515cb4E1EDa4AaDCCC7a4D3E9503889f97`
    *   *(Reason: Ownership has been permanently renounced due to an error in the initial deployment parameters.)*
